## Developer Experience

### WeasyPrint
- Learning curve is relative, but genrally quite low since it builds layouts using HTML and CSS.
- There is more control in terms of styling a page, because of CSS functionalites
- Good support for images and different fonts even CDN hosted fonts (since it allows for HTML and CSS)
- Allows for reusable templates (HTML, CSS)
- Fit for different document styles

### fpdf2
- Allows for reusable templates
- Seems to be better fit for tabular document styles, e.g invoices, etc
- Styling is also done programmatically

### reportlab
- Learning curve is medium, as it not requires Python but also some coordinate geometry for positioning objects (text, images, etc) in PDFs
- Allows for templating as well (with python functions) but might be more complicated as it coordinate geometry is required
